            <p>Gator Judo is a sports club at the University of Florida in Gainesville which is affiliated with Rec Sports. It is open to UF students and others affiliated with the University of Florida and is free for students. Our experienced sensei teach students, many of whom start out with no experience, the techniques and principles of judo, which is an Olympic Sport involving throwing techniques and matwork, including submissions. We do have a competition team, but competing is optional. Judo is a physical and mental discipline that promotes personal growth and benefit to others. Itâ€™s not easy, but few good things in life are.
